# Weights are saved in different folders that represent the different Neural Network models used.

# In each folder, weights are stored with the following name:
weights-improvement-{model and trained version}-{epoch}-{validation loss}.hdf5

Example:
weights-improvement-v1.0-01-4.04.hdf5
model v1
trained version 0
epoch 1
validation loss 4.04
