# In this folder we store the generated data with record_data.launch.

# Each data generation is stored in different folders (data_#) to keep an order of different recordings.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

# TO RECORD DATA:

In the simulator workspace (fss_ws):

- Run the simulator. 
  Eg. to drive with ps3 joystick:
  roslaunch fs_simulator manual_control_ps3.launch

- Run in a new terminal:
  roslaunch imitation_learning record_data.launch

- Drive simulator to obtain new data

- End recording with ctr+C in the last terminal

# AFTER RECORDING DATA:

- New .bag file present in imitation_learning/data. Cut this file into a new imitation_learning/data/data_# folder.

- In terminal, move to imitation_learning/scripts folder (ROS workspace must be sourced and Conda environment must be activated)

- Run the following command for data conversion:
  python rosbag_to_csv.py 
  Example:
  python rosbag_to_csv.py -o /home/agus/fs_ws/imitation_learning/output/data_3 -i /home/agus/ros/fs_ws/src/imitation_learning/data/data_3

- If /data_# was not specified ⇒ after conversion (To keep an ORDER with new generated data):
	1) cut the .bag files in the "data" folder into a new "data/data_#" folder. Being # the next number.
	2) cut the generated files in the "output" folder (all except the README and the data_# folders) into a new "output/data_#" folder.

-Data in "output" folder is the one used for training.
